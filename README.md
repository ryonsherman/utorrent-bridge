Overview
--------
**uTorrent Bridge** allows you to perform native [uTorrent][utorrent] WebUI requests on non-native servers. This enables the use of uTorrent remotes such as [uRemote](http://uremote.blogspot.com/) and [Torrent-fu](http://torrent-fu.com/) on non-uTorrent servers.

Non-native server interaction is provided by modular, community created, libraries.
